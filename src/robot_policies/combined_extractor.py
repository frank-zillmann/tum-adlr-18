    Each sub-extractor processes its own subset of the observation space,

            kwargs_dict contains arguments for that extractor (excluding observation_space)
            Each extractor's features_dim will be set automatically based on the config.

    Example:

            (MeshRenderingExtractor, {"features_dim": 128}),
